# Titanic-classification-comprehensive-modeling
This kernel may (or may not) be helpful in your long and often tedious machine learning journey. This kernel is easily understandable to the beginner like me. This verbosity tries to explain everything I could possibly know. Once you get through the notebook, you can find this useful and straightforward. I attempted to explain things as simple as possible.  In this kernel, I'm going to attempt the only Machine learning Algorithms to predict if a passenger survived from the sinking Titanic or not. So it's a binary classification problem.  Keep Learning,  Fakhre Alam
